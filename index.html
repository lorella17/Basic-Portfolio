            Born and raised in a small town where roads remain unpaved in Guatemala.  My mothe migrated to the U.S when i was 5
            leaving me behind with my grandma in search of the american dream.  Saw my mother again at the age of 10 when she
            finally received residency status for her and myself.  Moved to the U.S in 1995, lived in Los Angeles 2 and half years
            prior to moving to Atlanta.  Attended The University of Georgia where i received my undergraduate degree in business
            management from Terry School of Business.  Became the first member of my extended family to graduate from a University.
            Pay for my education working at a local logistics company, where i have reached my peak and looking for a new challege
            that will take my career to the next level.

        <p>
            During the last year i began considering a career change.  I have applied to several different positions in the
            Logistics/Transportation industry, but have yet to find a new job.  One of the main reasons has really been my
            loyalty to the current company i work for.  Most recently after finally realizing that my career has reach a stagnant
            point i decided it was time to move on.  I wanted a new challenge and be part of the ongoing changes technology
            and its fast paced field offer.  This course will not be easy but if it were easy everyoen would be a software developer.
            I hope to learn and get my career moving again in the path in which it should have never stopped.  I am a learner,
            inovator and becasue of that i have no doubt success is up in the air along with the right company and oppo.
